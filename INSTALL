Basic Installation
==================

First make sure you have the kdevplatform module installed, it's also available
from KDE's subversion repository in trunk/KDE/kdevplatform.

Create a build directory, for example:
mkdir build

Then run cmake and point it to the sources like this:
cmake ../

A useful option to specify for the cmake command is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX so 
that you can tell cmake where to install the software. For example, to install
in /usr/kde/4 you would run:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/kde/4

Afterwards run:
make

And to install run:
make install
